# Amogus

Source code for [Amogus Rage Game](https://gamejolt.com/games/amogus/656077), my first ever Godot project from back in 2021.

I always promise to release source code for my games a couple years after they're out, and this one is not an exception.
Do mind the code quality however, VERY first game I ever made. I will probably try to port it to the latest version of Godot soon.
